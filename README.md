# SARMIC_
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology in satellite imaging is a powerful tool used for capturing high-resolution images of the Earth's surface, regardless of weather conditions or lighting. Unlike optical imaging, which relies on sunlight, SAR uses microwave signals to create detailed images, making it particularly valuable for monitoring areas with frequent cloud cover or in darkness. SAR is widely used for applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, land deformation analysis, and military reconnaissance, providing essential data for mapping, monitoring changes, and assessing natural events like floods and earthquakes.

In this project, we are using GAN model to colorize black-and-white satellite images, improving visual clarity and detail.
Utilized TensorFlow/Keras with perceptual loss (VGG19) for improved accuracy and realistic colorization.
